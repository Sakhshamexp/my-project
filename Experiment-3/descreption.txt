HTML PART
I started with the basic <!DOCTYPE html> to set the document type.
In the <head>, I gave the page a title and linked my CSS file (style.css).
I added a hidden checkbox <input type="checkbox" id="theme"> which I’m using for the light/dark mode switch.
Then I made a <div class="grid"> – this is the main container that holds everything in a grid layout.
<header> goes at the top and has the title Admin Dashboard plus a label for the dark mode toggle.
<nav> is my sidebar menu with links like Home, Users, and Settings.
<main> is the main content area where I put the welcome message.
<footer> is at the bottom with a copyright.


CSS PART
In :root, I set up color variables for the header, footer, sidebar, main area, and text. This makes it easy to change the theme.
For body, I used a simple sans-serif font.

I hid the input with display: none so the checkbox doesn’t actually show up on the page.

.grid is where I set up the CSS Grid layout – two columns (sidebar + main content) and three rows (header, content, footer). I also gave it a red border to match what you wanted.
header spans across both columns, has the header background color, and uses flexbox to space out the title and dark mode label.

nav is the sidebar with its own background and some padding.
main is the main content area with padding, background color, and text color from the variables.
footer also spans across both columns and is centered.
input:checked ~ .grid is where the magic happens — when the checkbox is checked, the color variables switch to the dark theme.
