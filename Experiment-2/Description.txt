HTML PART
<div class="bank">
This part is like the main wrapper. i put everything inside this so things stays center and doesn't look messy. it also helps to control space and layout easily.

<div class="box">
this is the white box where i kept balance and both buttons. it looks like card but i didn’t name it that. gives proper gap around stuff so its not just floating.

<h2 class="balance">$5000</h2>
this shows the money. i used h2 to make it bigger, and with class “balance” i made it green n bold so it pops.

<button class="btn deposit"> and <button class="btn withdraw">
these are the 2 buttons for deposit and withdraw. both using same class “btn” so they look same style, just diff names for action.

CSS PART
body
I used flex and aligned things center so that the whole thing comes in middle of screen. Also used light grey background so page doesn’t look boring.

.bank
This keeps the size under control. I set width like 85% and max-width 400px so it looks good on phone also. Also centered it using margin: auto.

.box
This is the white area. I gave it padding and border-radius so it’s a bit round. Also added background white. It's the layout part I added like you asked (from that pic).

.balance
This is the money text. I made font-size bigger like 35px and made it green. Added margin-bottom so the buttons don’t touch it.

.btn
These are for both buttons. Made width 100% so they stretch across, and gave some padding. Color is blue with black text, and when mouse hover it changes to dark blue. Added border-radius to make it a bit round.
