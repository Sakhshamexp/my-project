This React component, Onlinestore, is designed to help users manage and track 
orders in an online store. It displays a dynamic list of orders, each containing 
an ID, product name, and status. Initially, the component starts with one sample 
order to demonstrate functionality. 

The component uses the useState hook to manage the state of the orders array 
as well as the input fields for adding new orders. This allows React to 
remember the data even when the component re-renders. Each input field is 
controlled, meaning its value is tied directly to React state, ensuring 
synchronization between the UI and the data. 

A form is provided with three input fields: one for the order ID, one for 
the product name, and one for the order status. All fields are required, 
preventing submission if any are empty. When the user submits the form, 
the addOrder function is triggered. This function prevents the default 
form submission behavior (page reload), adds the new order to the list, 
and then clears the input fields for convenience. 

The list of orders is rendered dynamically using the map function, where 
each order is displayed in a list item. React uses a unique key for each 
order to efficiently update the UI when new orders are added. This demonstrates 
how React's state management and controlled inputs work together to create 
an interactive and responsive interface. 

Overall, this component is a simple but effective example of managing 
state in React, handling forms, updating lists dynamically, and ensuring 
a smooth user experience in a small-scale online store application.
