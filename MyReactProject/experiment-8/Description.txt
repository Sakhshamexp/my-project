ðŸ“˜ Digital Library UI â€“ Description

COMPONENT: BookManager
    Purpose:
        Provides a simple interface to organize a digital collection of books (title and author).
    Features:
        Search Bar â†’ Lets users filter the visible book list instantly by typing keywords in title/author.
        Add Book â†’ Accepts new book details (title & author) and appends them to the collection.
        Delete Book â†’ Each book has a delete option to remove it from the collection.
    Effect:
        Demonstrates how React state and event handling can be used to make the interface update live without page refresh.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
    - Gained practice in managing state with Reactâ€™s useState hook.
    - Understood handling of user-driven events like input typing, form submission, and button clicks.
    - Learned to dynamically update UI elements like lists using filtering and mapping.
    - Improved ability to design React component structures and apply custom CSS styling.
