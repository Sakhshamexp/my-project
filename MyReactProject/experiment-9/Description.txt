Class Hierarchy: Person, Student, and Teacher

CLASS: Person
    Purpose:
        Acts as the base class for all people.
    Attributes:
        - name: Must be a string with only alphabetic characters.
        - age: Must be a positive integer.
    Methods:
        - getDetails(): Returns "Name: [name], Age: [age]".
    Effect:
        Provides shared data and behavior that other classes can extend.

CLASS: Student (inherits Person)
    Purpose:
        Represents a student with additional academic details.
    Extra Attribute:
        - course/grade: String indicating the enrolled program or grade level.
    Methods:
        - getDetails(): Overridden to return "Name: [name], Age: [age], Course: [course]".
    Effect:
        Extends Person with student-specific information.

CLASS: Teacher (inherits Person)
    Purpose:
        Represents a teacher with subject expertise.
    Extra Attribute:
        - subject/department: String representing the subject taught.
    Methods:
        - getDetails(): Overridden to return "Name: [name], Age: [age], Subject: [subject]".
    Effect:
        Extends Person with teacher-specific information.

IMPLEMENTATION OUTLINE
    - Define a Person class with name, age, and a getDetails() method.
    - Create a Student subclass:
        * Inherits name and age.
        * Adds course/grade property.
        * Redefines getDetails() to include the course.
    - Create a Teacher subclass:
        * Inherits name and age.
        * Adds subject/department property.
        * Redefines getDetails() to include the subject.
    - Instantiate Student and Teacher objects to demonstrate inheritance and method overriding.

LEARNING TAKEAWAYS
    - Built a reusable base class in JavaScript using ES6 syntax.
    - Understood inheritance and how subclasses extend a parent class.
    - Practiced method overriding to tailor subclass behavior.
    - Strengthened understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript.

Person Class Hierarchy with Student and Teacher Subclasses – Description
CLASS: Person
    ->Purpose: Defines the base structure for all persons.
    ->Properties:
        name: Required, string type (only alphabets allowed).
        age: Required, numeric type (positive integer).
    ->Methods:
        getDetails(): Returns "Name: [name], Age: [age]".
        Effect: Provides common attributes and methods that can be reused by subclasses.

CLASS: Student (extends Person)
    ->Purpose: Specialized subclass for student details.
    ->Additional Property:
        course or grade: Required, string type (represents enrolled course or grade).
    ->Methods:
        Overrides getDetails() → Returns "Name: [name], Age: [age], Course: [course]".
    ->Effect: Adds student-specific information while still inheriting from Person.

CLASS: Teacher (extends Person)
    ->Purpose: Specialized subclass for teacher details.
    ->Additional Property:
        subject or department: Required, string type (represents subject taught).
    ->Methods:
        Overrides getDetails() → Returns "Name: [name], Age: [age], Subject: [subject]".
    ->Effect: Adds teacher-specific details while still reusing base class properties.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
    ->Create a Person class with properties name, age, and a method getDetails().
    ->Create Student subclass:
        Inherits name and age from Person.
        Adds new property course.
        Overrides getDetails() to include course.
    ->Create Teacher subclass:
        Inherits name and age from Person.
        Adds new property subject.
        Overrides getDetails() to include subject.
    ->Create instances of Student and Teacher to demonstrate inheritance and method overriding.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
    Learned how to create a base class in JavaScript using ES6.
    Understood inheritance and how subclasses extend functionality.
    Practiced method overriding to customize behavior in subclasses.
