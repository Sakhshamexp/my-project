HTML PART

For the HTML part, I started with the normal structure and gave the page a title.
In the body, I added a heading just to show the name of the project.
Then I put a textarea so that the user can type anything.
Below that, I added a line which shows “Characters:” and beside it a span that starts at 0.
This number is what changes when we type in the textarea.
Basically, the HTML is just setting up the layout – one box for input and one place to show the count.

JAVASCRIPT PART

In the JavaScript part, I connected the textarea and the span using their IDs.
After that, I used an event listener for the textarea so that whenever something is typed or deleted, it triggers a small function.
Inside that function, I checked the length of the text typed and updated the span with that number.
So as soon as we type, the character count increases, and if we delete, it decreases.
This makes the counter update live without refreshing the page.
